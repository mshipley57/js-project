        <h1>Determine Your Coding Track!</h1>
        <p>When enrolling in a new coding school, everyone's first question is: "Which track should I pick?" No worries! I've organized a simple quiz to help you find the right track for you!</p>

        <form id="jsquiz">
          <div class="form=group">
            <label for="company">What sort of place would you like to work?</label>
            <select id="company">
              <option value="bigcompany">To work at a company so big, it will take over the world!</option>

            </select>

          <div class="form-group">
            <label for="versatility">Do you want an extremely versatile language, or one where the use is mostly predictable?</label>
            <select id="versatility">
              <option value="notpredict">I want to be constantly surprised by what my language can do!</option>
              <option value="defpredict">I want predictability, and stability, and one day a pet cat who loves me for me, and not just the treats in my pocket.</option>
